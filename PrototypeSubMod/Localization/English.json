  "ProtoPrecursorIngotEncy_Title": "Alien Modular Framework",
  "ProtoPrecursorIngotEncy_Body": "An advanced material with high structural integrity. Its core, a modified form of a foundational alien building block, appears to stabilize 8 external frames used for dynamic construction. This PDA was unable to fully synthesize the original material's composition and had to change some elements.\nThis may lead to slightly lower durability.\n\nAnalysis:\n- High structural integrity\n- Useful for reinforced alien construction\n- Requires multiple advanced materials",
  "ProtoCloakEncy_Title": "Light Distortion Field",
  "ProtoCloakEncy_Body": "This schematic provides missing data relating to previously non-functional light refractors scattered across the hull of the Prototype. The data describes that the refractors are capable of generating a radius around the Prototype whereby most external light is dynamically bent around the submarine, effectively preventing all external light from reaching the Prototype.\n\nIt is clear that the intended use for this technology is to evade detection from aggressive fauna during emergency scenarios, leading to a relatively high ionic power draw.\n\n<b>WARNING:</b> According to the available schematics, the reflective barrier does <b>NOT</b> appear to affect the ability for the Prototype to be sensed through vibrations and sound.",
  "ProtoEmergencyWarpEncy_Title": "Emergency Warp Protocol",
  "ProtoEmergencyWarpEncy_Body": "This schematic contains a backdoor protocol for the Prototype's archway interceptor which enables it to instantaneously transport the vessel to a pre-specified location; Likely the submarine's point of construction.\n- Due to the immense concentration of dark energy delegated to this protocol, it is reccomended that it only be used in extremely dire situations, and not as a means of mundane traversal.",
  "ProtoInterceptorEncy_Title": "Archway Interceptor",
  "ProtoInterceptorEncy_Body": "The data from this schematic matches data seen in background scans of previously-encountered matter transportation terminals. The schematic appears to enable functioning of an onboard matter transportation device; Allowing the user to instantaneously transport themselves to any activated alien transportation archway. However, no protocols currently exist in this schematic to enable the user to access it from the primary archway network.\n\nThe following additional data has been extracted:\n- Each transport requires and consumes 1 ion cube.\n- One-way transportation only.\n- Data from each alien archway is required to enable teleportation to it.\n- The schematics include 1 built-in set of archway data.",

  "ProtoIonBarrierEncy_Title": "Ion Barrier",
  "ProtoIonBarrierEncy_Body": "This schematic links previously non-functional ion energy emitters lining the hull of the Prototype. The energy field generated from these emitters creates a thin electrostatic mesh surrounding the vessel capable of absorbing blunt force impacts. The maximum capacity for the energy cells powering the energy emitters is limited, meaning that the barrier may require time to recharge in-between activations and may only fully protect the vessel for a few seconds at a time.",
  "ProtoStasisPulseEncy_Title": "Stasis Pulse",
  "ProtoStasisPulseEncy_Body": "This schematic uses energy emitters surrounding the hull of the ship to passively collect and discharge underwater electrostatic energy. The discharge of this energy closely resembles the latest defensive developments in the <i>Survival-Grade Alterra Stasis Rifle</i>. Upon charge and activation, the electrostatic pulse will temporarily paralyse nearby biological tissues including muscles, some internal organs and all brain activity.\n\nThe following additional data was extracted:\n- Paralysis of nearby organisms is dependent on their size. Larger organisms may regain mental functioning faster than smaller ones- Potentially leading to instantaneous death of small creatures.\n- The maximum capacity for the energy cells powering the electrostatic emitters is limited, meaning that the pulse may require time to recharge in-between activations and will consume a significant amount of stored energy.\n\n<b>Warning: Experiencing a discharge from this module may semi-permanently damage key cognitive functions such as muscle control, mental clarity and communication from the brain stem to vital and sensory organs causing potential brain death from cerebral hypoxia within 10 minutes of infliction. Avoid at all costs.</b>",
  "ProtoIonGeneratorEncy_Title": "Ion Generator",
  "ProtoIonGeneratorEncy_Body": "By conserving power from all non-essential systems onboard the submersible, this module allows the Ion engine to alter its functioning to serve as a localized fusion reactor- Slowly regenerating power over time in exchange for a loss of functionality onboard the submersible.\n\nThe following additional data was extracted:\n- Due to the extreme conservation of  power necessary to carry out the fusion reaction, the following systems are non-functional while the Ion generator is active:\n   - Defense modules\n   - Ion thrusters\n\n- If left unsupervised for extended periods of time, there is a significant risk of the leaking of dangerous gamma radiation and neutron projectiles escaping the reaction chamber and tearing holes through the ship’s hull.\n- The sub-atomic collisions generated from the fusion reactor may cause detectable vibrations up to 200 meters away.",
  "ProtoOverclockEncy_Title": "Overclock Module",
  "ProtoOverclockEncy_Body": "This protocol appears to temporarily sever several safety protocols related to energy regulation and the frequency at which instructions are sent from the Ion engine to the vessel’s primary thruster. On activation of this protocol, the vessel will expend a significant amount of energy in exchange for increasing the power running through the ship’s Ion thruster- Resulting in an increased speed.\n\nThe following additional data was extracted:\n- Haphazard use of the overclock module may result in weak points in the vessel’s exterior receiving heavy wear- Potentially resulting in spontaneous hull breaches.",
  "ProtoDeployableLightEncy_Title": "Photon Beacon",
  "ProtoDeployableLightEncy_Body": "This device appears to have been designed either as a navigational and visual aid, or as a decoy for small to medium sized fauna; perhaps both. Its design seems to accommodate for a central exothermic and chemiluminescent reaction contained within two halves of the device held together using precise sound waves. The energy contained within this sample is enough to illuminate the device’s surroundings a few hundred meters in each direction, and will last for approximately five minutes.",
  "ProtoIonPrismEncy_Title": "Ion Prism",
  "ProtoIonPrismEncy_Body": "This object consists of two prismatic crystals fused together to minimize external surface area, as well as three smaller crystals affixed to the uppermost component. The energy contained within the prism is approximated to scale logarithmically with the quantity of ion cubes stored within it. If released, the resulting thermonuclear explosion would reach a distance of over 50 kilometers in all directions, and would prove fatal to all life forms within 3.3 kilometers- Enough to eradicate most of if not all biological life within the crater. In its current state, it does not seem possible nor wise to attempt to extract the energy from its container. Therefore, in order to use this object to power equipment, currently undiscovered technology would be needed.\n\n<b>Assessment: Handle with utmost care</b>",
  "OrionFacilityLogs_Title": "Maternal Megafauna Aggression Research Data",
  "OrionFacilityLogs_Body": "According to translated data logs, this facility was first constructed to develop defensive technologies for the global dead zone mapping initiative. These technologies were specifically designed to protect a vessel of a similar description to the one previously-constructed at the Quarantine Enforcement Platform, albeit with distinct changes to its on-board operative systems, against leviathan-class lifeforms inhabiting the ecological dead zone surrounding the crater.\n\nHowever, a more recent development in this facility’s directives follows a command issued by an executive member of the alien hierarchy involving leviathan-class embryo study for the larger bacterium research project, of which the dead zone mapping initiative is a subsidiary. Following this command, this facility began preparations to collect a leviathan-class egg sample and study the aggressive behaviours of the egg’s parent in a controlled environment. This project’s data file ends abruptly during this phase, however, and no results are present within the following logs.",
  "DefenseFacilityLogs_Title": "Defense Facility Audit Logs",
  "DefenseFacilityLogs_Body": "This terminal appears to have been controlling the parameters surrounding this facility’s lockdown procedure which, prior to deactivation, involved a physical exterior barricade, complete internal data protection, and the distortion of nearby photon particles in an effort to cloak the sensitive internals of the facility.\n\nThe following information was decrypted from the onboard audit log:\n- The facility was constructed slightly following the erection of the Quarantine Enforcement Platform, and appears to be linked via a constant data stream to three other facilities in addition to the Quarantine Enforcement Platform.\n- The structure appears to have been specially positioned in a highly defensible location, and operational logs dictate that the facility was constructed in order to research the maternal aggression of megafauna inhabiting the ecological dead zone beyond the facility’s frontal barrier.\n- In order to control the damage done to the facility from megafauna attacks, several defensive technologies were researched and utilised to varying degrees within the facility. These technologies include schematics for a light distortion field, an ionic barrier system, and a momentary electrostatic pulse emitter.\n- Following a directive from a sibling facility much deeper underwater, this facility’s primary directive was to determine the aggression of a particular megafauna organism in order to ensure the safety of the sibling facility in its own analytic endeavours. However, an irregularity in the facility’s audit log history suggests that this directive was quickly abandoned following an impromptu command issued within the sibling facility, leading to the defensive technologies developed in this facility to be used to enact an irreversible lockdown, containing all life forms within it.\n- The final audit message indicates that this lockdown was lifted mere seconds ago.",

  "ProtoWarpReactorEncy_Title": "Warp Core",
  "ProtoWarpReactorEncy_Body": "This alien artifact, taking the shape of a square bipyramid, appears to be harbouring massive amounts of concentrated dark energy not entirely dissimilar to the kind found within the Aurora’s dark matter reactor.

  "ProtoWormEncy_Body": "A highly advanced tool, this robotic specimen is capable of large-scale resource extraction and subterranian self-navigation. It does not exhibit any directly aggressive tendencies. However, due the high concentration of rare minerals in Alterra technology, it may still pose a substantial threat to submersible hull integrity and overall safety if it deems such technology worth extracting.\n\n1. Mineral extraction equipment:\nThis autonomous device is equipped with highly advanced material extraction technologies. A frontal set of rotating frames exceeding 1,500 degrees Celcius serve to melt the outer layers of bedrock and minerals before passing them down through the specimen's body.\n\n2. Material transportation:\nThe “spine” of the specimen controls a powerful beam of a plasma-like substance which directs the flow of liquid mineral resources, distributing it throughout each spine segment which slowly fill with raw minerals as the wyrm moves through the ground.\n\n3. Profile:\nThe specimen measures a total of 220 metres in length. It appears to disregard the presence of living fauna, suggesting purely practical applications. Because the Alterra Corporation has not published specifications regarding the class assignment “leviathan” to cybernetic or robotic phenomena, this PDA will assign this specimen the class designation Xenoleviathan.

This suggests that the device was likely used to collect such resources from hard layers of upper bedrock found in biomes exceeding 200m in depth. Despite the use of hostile architecture through spikes extending down the spine of the device, it is unclear whether it was used strictly as a means of resource collection or alien defense.\n\n<b>Assessment: May prove hazardous while functioning; Do not attempt to re-activate</b>",
  "HullFacilityWormTerminalEncy_Title": "Dead Zone Mapping Initiative Project Data",
  "HullFacilityWormTerminalEncy_Body": "According to translated administrative logs, the dead zone mapping initiative, a subsidiary of the bacterium research project, was enacted to supplement a design limitation in the aliens’ existing satellite technology: Depth.\n\nIn an effort to broaden their search for a viable cure to the Khaara bacterium, the aliens began the development of a vessel capable of handling near infinite external pressure and autonomous self-sufficiency. Four facilities were constructed, each developing one aspect of the vessel’s abilities. The Ion reactor allowed the vessel to infinitely recharge using external pressure, the archway interceptor used a network of dark energy sources to precisely geolocate at great depths, the vessel’s defensive measures allowed for protection against leviathan-class lifeforms, and the culmination of these branches’ research was assembled in the Prototype Administrative Facility.\n\nHowever, unforeseen circumstances in the bacterium research project forced the dead zone mapping initiative to cease production of the vessel, and its researchers to abandon the project. \n\nBased on this log, it is unclear how the Prototype now stands.

Treatment will continue on schedule. The resource collection network has been placed on standby. The NSP dictates an eventual re-activation of the selected construct, by which time fragmentation will have long been completed. The predicted animate entropy vessel will encounter this terminal if it is compatible. As I send my regards, I remind it: It cannot fail.”",
  "AnimateEntropyTerminalEncy_Title": "Animate Entropy Cultivation",
  "AnimateEntropyTerminalEncy_Body": "According to translated data logs, this environment was designed to imitate the natural growth conditions for a resource referred to as “animate entropy”, which is reported to have been of critical importance in the harvesting of dark energy and was reportedly discovered by a robotics researcher in the Prototype Administrative Facility.\n\nAs such, this facility was likely used to naturally cultivate animate entropy for the research of warp technologies through dark matter manipulation. This research appears to have, at one point, been delegated to both self-warping constructs and the “dead zone mapping initiative”, but was later consolidated into self-warping construct production following the closure of the latter project.\n\nA seemingly unused data point mentions the application of animate entropy to something referred to as the “NSP”.

While it is unclear how this liquid is extracted, it is used to coat the vessel in a thin layer of reinforcement as external water pressure rises, thereby increasing the maximum crush depth of the vessel. Each individual fin contains enough fluid to increase the Prototype’s maximum crush depth by approximately 175 meters.\n\n<b>Propulsion</b>\nSmall energy receptors lining each fin acts as a siphon to extract energy from the Prototype’s ion reactor. This energy is then channeled into propulsive thrusters located at the bottom of each fin to increase maximum speed by 0.15m/s.",

  "ProtoBuildTerminal_Body": "This device seems to be the origin of the recently-detected neural analysis. Thankfully, the device has been calibrated only to read neural data, and not to write it.\n\nThe device itself appears to serve two primary functions.\n\n1. Data storage:\nThe device harbours a form of algorithmic software referred to as a neural cluster suspended between the upper and lower halves of the structure. The neural cluster is marked with seed code “Orion”, a name typically reserved for the famous earth constellation, but that may be a universal identifier. In this case, it is being used possibly as a project title or specimen identification.\n\nThe device is being constantly fed large amounts of highly encrypted data from an unnamed source, likely an off-planet database. The data follows a fractal-like organizational pattern, suggesting infinite possible situational data under infinitely increasing conditions, allowing the terminal to adapt to situational factors in real-time.\n\n2. Vessel construction:\nThe two structures to either side of the terminal appear to be energy storage devices designed to passively gather and quickly discharge large bursts of energy to the central terminal. The drones hovering around the terminal seem to be used to transmit matter. This indicates that the terminal may be used as a fabrication station for a piece of alien technology. Given the terminal’s position beside an enclosed moonpool, this technology is likely subaquatic in nature.\n\n<b>Assessment: Further research required.</b>",
