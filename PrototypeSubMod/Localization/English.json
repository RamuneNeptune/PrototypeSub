  // Ency entries
  "EncyPath_DownloadedData/Precursor/ProtoUpgrades": "Prototype Sub Upgrades",
  "ProtoPrecursorIngotEncy_Title": "Alien Ingot",
  "ProtoPrecursorIngotEncy_Body": "An advanced material with high structural integrity. Scanned from the quarantine enforcement platform, this PDA was unable to fully synthesize the material's composition and had to change some elements.\nThis will therefore lead to slightly lower durability.\n\nAnalysis:\n- High structural integrity\n- Useful for extreme pressure vessels\n- Requires multiple advanced materials",
  "ProtoCloakEncy_Title": "Light Distortion Field",
  "ProtoCloakEncy_Body": "This cache provides missing data relating to the previously non-functional light reflection emitters situated across the hull of the Prototype. The data describes that the light-reflection emitters are capable of generating a radius around the Prototype whereby all external light is perfectly captured and internally reflected- Effectively preventing all light from within its radius from escaping.\n\nThe schematics outline that the reflective barrier extends to 60 meters in height, 60 meters from portside to starboard, as well as 100 meters from stern to bow.\n\nIt is clear that the intended use for this technology is to evade detection from predators, though no existing data can provide information regarding what species of fauna this vessel was designed to evade.\n\n<b>WARNING:</b> According to the available schematics, the reflective barrier does <b>NOT</b> appear to affect the ability for the Prototype to be sensed through vibrations and sound.",
  "ProtoEmergencyWarpEncy_Title": "Emergency Warp",
  "ProtoEmergencyWarpEncy_Body": "This cache appears to contain a backdoor protocol to the mini archway which enables it to instantaneously transport the Prototype submersible to a pre-specified location. The data corresponding to where this pre-specified location lies is unable to be decrypted.\n\nThe following additional data has been extracted:\n- Due to the immense concentration of energy necessary for this protocol to be activated, an energy equivalent of <b>four fully-charged ion power cells</b> must be available in order to activate it.\n- Due to incomplete energy-regulation technologies within this schematic, it can be inferred that <b>all available power will be exhausted upon activating this protocol</b>.",
  "ProtoInterceptorEncy_Title": "Archway Interceptor",
  "ProtoInterceptorEncy_Body": "The data from this schematic matches data seen in background scans of previously-encountered matter transportation terminals. The schematic appears to enable functioning of an onboard matter transportation device; Allowing the user to instantaneously transport themselves to any activated alien transportation archway. However, no protocols currently exist in this schematic to enable the user to access it from the primary archway network.\n\nThe following additional data has been extracted:\n- Each transport requires and consumes 1 ion cube.\n- One-way transportation only.\n- Data from each alien archway is required to enable teleportation to it.\n- The schematics include 1 built-in set of archway data.",
  "ProtoRepairDroidsEncy_Title": "Repair Droids",
  "ProtoRepairDroidsEncy_Body": "This upgrade details protocols enabling access to previously non-functional autonomous maintenance robot assembly depots. Maintenance robot construction schematics match data seen in background scans at previously-discovered alien facilities.\n\nThe following additional data was extracted:\n- Maintenance robots possess advanced welding technology capable of repairing external hull damage over time.\n- Safety protocols onboard maintenance robots prevent passive hull repair during creature attacks.",
  "ProtoPressureConvertersEncy_Title": "Hydrological Pressure Converters",
  "ProtoPressureConvertersEncy_Body": "This protocol activates passive pressure converters built into the hull of the Prototype. These pressure converters appear to have the ability to regulate energy reuptake at great depths.\n\nThe following additional data was extracted:\n- Energy efficiency increases with depths beginning at 800 meters below sea level.",
  "ProtoIonBarrierEncy_Title": "Ion Barrier",
  "ProtoIonBarrierEncy_Body": "This schematic links previously non-functional ion energy emitters lining the hull of the submersible. The nuclear energy field generated with these emitters creates a thin electrostatic mesh surrounding the vessel capable of absorbing blunt force impacts. The energy absorbed with this barrier uses reserve power directly proportional to the impact force; The more substantial the impact, the more energy must be consumed to deflect it.\n\nThe following additional data was extracted:\n- Light emitter subroutines appear to be inaccessible while the barrier is active.\n- Due to the encompassing nature of the mesh, disembarking the vessel is impossible while the barrier is active.\n- The maximum capacity for the energy cells powering the energy emitters is limited, meaning that the barrier may require time to recharge in-between activations and may be slow to fully protect the vessel.",
  "ProtoStasisPulseEncy_Title": "Stasis Pulse",
  "ProtoStasisPulseEncy_Body": "This schematic uses energy emitters surrounding the hull of the ship to passively collect and discharge underwater electrostatic energy. The discharge of this energy closely resembles the latest defensive developments in the <i>Survival-Grade Alterra Stasis Rifle</i>. Upon charge and activation, the electrostatic pulse will temporarily paralyse nearby biological tissues including muscles, some internal organs and all brain activity.\n\nThe following additional data was extracted:\n- Paralysis of nearby organisms is dependent on their size. Larger organisms may regain mental functioning faster than smaller ones- Potentially leading to instantaneous death of small creatures.\n- The maximum capacity for the energy cells powering the electrostatic emitters is limited, meaning that the pulse may require time to recharge in-between activations and will consume a significant amount of stored energy.\n\n<b>Warning: Experiencing a discharge from this module may semi-permanently damage key cognitive functions such as muscle control, mental clarity and communication from the brain stem to vital and sensory organs causing potential brain death from cerebral hypoxia within 10 minutes of infliction. Avoid at all costs.</b>",
  "ProtoVentilatorsEncy_Title": "Hydrodynamic Ventilators",
  "ProtoVentilatorsEncy_Body": "This schematic allows for more specialized functioning of ventilation grills lining the bow of the submersible. Adding protocols for adapting grill dimensions and orientation to increased water pressure, this module allows the Prototype submersible to more efficiently jettison water for greater propulsion at increased depths.\n\nThe following additional data was extracted:\n- Protocol specifies hydrodynamic ventilation at a minimum depth of <b>1000 meters</b> below sea level in order to conserve power.\n- At depths in excess of <b>10,000 meters</b>, the hydrodynamic ventilation fails to compensate for increased water pressure and its effects on the vessel’s speed greatly diminish.",
  "ProtoIonGeneratorEncy_Title": "Ion Generator",
  "ProtoIonGeneratorEncy_Body": "By conserving power from all non-essential systems onboard the submersible, this module allows the Ion engine to alter its functioning to serve as a localized fusion reactor- Slowly regenerating power over time in exchange for a loss of functionality onboard the submersible.\n\nThe following additional data was extracted:\n- Due to the extreme conservation of  power necessary to carry out the fusion reaction, the following systems are non-functional while the Ion generator is active:\n   - Defense modules\n   - Ion thrusters\n   - Archway interceptor\n   - Loading bay\n- If left unsupervised for extended periods of time, there is a significant risk of the leaking of dangerous gamma radiation and neutron projectiles escaping the reaction chamber and tearing holes through the ship’s hull.\n- The sub-atomic collisions generated from the fusion reactor may cause detectable vibrations up to 200 meters away.",
  "ProtoOverclockEncy_Title": "Overclock Module",
  "ProtoOverclockEncy_Body": "This protocol appears to temporarily sever several safety protocols related to energy regulation and the frequency at which instructions are sent from the Ion engine to the vessel’s primary thruster. On activation of this protocol, the vessel will expend a significant amount of energy in exchange for increasing the power running through the ship’s Ion thruster- Resulting in an increased speed.\n\nThe following additional data was extracted:\n- Haphazard use of the overclock module may result in weak points in the vessel’s exterior receiving heavy wear- Potentially resulting in spontaneous hull breaches.",
  "ProtoDeployableLightEncy_Title": "Deployable Light",
  "ProtoDeployableLightEncy_Body": "The data downloaded from this data cache include the schematics for a deployable device designed as a navigational and visual aid. The protocol counterpart appears to enable the deployment of this device from an onboard loading bay situated at the bow of the Prototype.\n\nThe following additional data was extracted:\n- Upon deployment, the light beacon will eject from the Prototype’s hull and remain stationary for approximately two minutes.\n- When activated, a powerful chemical reaction within the beacon will emit a powerful stream of light in all directions.\n- The dually-segmented anchors in this device appear to utilize a precise stream of sound waves in order to contain the chemiluminescent reaction suspended between them. It is possible that this sound may be audible to fauna with a substantially-developed sense of hearing.\n- The rotating of the device’s anchors is unpredictable, likely caused by the erraticity of the light source’s highly exothermic reaction. Exercise caution when approaching the beacon’s core as there is a substantial risk of this reaction causing skin irritation, rashes, and sudden loss of external tissues.",
  "ProtoIonPrismEncy_Title": "Ion Prism",
  "ProtoIonPrismEncy_Body": "This object consists of two prismatic crystals fused together to minimize external surface area, as well as three smaller crystals affixed to the uppermost component. The energy contained within the prism is approximated to reach over thirteen trillion Joules of energy. If released, the resulting thermonuclear explosion would reach a distance of 62.3 kilometers in all directions, and would prove fatal to all life forms within 3.3 kilometers- Enough to eradicate most of if not all biological life within the crater. In its current state, it does not seem possible nor wise to attempt to extract the energy from its container. In order to use this object to power equipment, currently undiscovered technology would be needed.\n\n<b>Assessment: HANDLE WITH EXTREME CAUTION</b>",
  "OrionFacilityLogs_Title": "The Orion Neural Cluster",
  "OrionFacilityLogs_Body": "Following an expedition to an unnamed planet, it appears the aliens created a new, highly chaotic form of artificial intelligence using the twin systems referred to as ┅▞┃ and  ┅▖┃▜ . If further data surrounding these systems can be collected, a significant bonus will be waiting for you at Alterra HQ.\n\nNeural cluster testing V.23.1.18: ‘Or-Ion’\nCluster density: 2008 ━▞▄▄▞┏┃/ ▜\n┓┗┏┣┏┣┅┓▚ database access: RESTRICTED\nCluster growth potential: Largest thus observed\nCluster morality: NON-FUNCTIONAL\nCandidate strength: MODERATE\n\nWARNING: EXPOSING V.23.1.18 TO INCOMPLETE SCHEMATICS MAY DAMAGE BIO-DETECTION SOFTWARE. AVOID.",
  "DefenseFacilityLogs_Title": "Defense Facility Audit Logs",
  "DefenseFacilityLogs_Body": "This terminal appears to have been controlling the parameters surrounding this facility’s lockdown procedure which, prior to deactivation, involved a physical exterior barricade, complete internal data protection, and the distortion of nearby photon particles in an effort to cloak the sensitive internals of the facility.\n\nThe following information was decrypted from the onboard audit log:\n- The facility was constructed slightly following the erection of the Quarantine Enforcement Platform, and appears to be linked via a constant data stream to three other facilities in addition to the Quarantine Enforcement Platform.\n- The structure appears to have been specially positioned in a highly defensible location, and operational logs dictate that the facility was constructed in order to research the maternal aggression of megafauna inhabiting the ecological dead zone beyond the facility’s frontal barrier.\n- In order to control the damage done to the facility from megafauna attacks, several defensive technologies were researched and utilised to varying degrees within the facility. These technologies include schematics for a light distortion field, an ionic barrier system, and a momentary electrostatic pulse emitter.\n- Following a directive from a sibling facility much deeper underwater, this facility’s primary directive was to determine the aggression of a particular megafauna organism in order to ensure the safety of the sibling facility in its own analytic endeavours. However, an irregularity in the facility’s audit log history suggests that this directive was quickly abandoned following an impromptu command issued within the sibling facility, leading to the defensive technologies developed in this facility to be used to enact an irreversible lockdown, containing all life forms within it.\n- The final audit message indicates that this lockdown was lifted mere seconds ago.",
  "ProtoDatabankEncy_Title": "Prototype Schematic",
  "ProtoDatabankEncy_Body": "The information downloaded from this terminal appears to harbor corruption patterns discordant with previously-downloaded alien data.\n\nPotential causes may include:\n- Data being written in an alternative alien language.\n- Data utilizing technology separate from other terminals encountered thus far.\n- Data entering hibernation over a period of time significantly longer than other terminals.\n\nThe usable extracted data describes the schematics for a large, highly robust and capable submersible seemingly used to collect precise geographical data from bodies of water at great depths.\n\nThe vessel schematic includes:\n- A default crush depth of 1000m [SUBJECT TO CHANGE]\n- Exterior light reflection emitters; Currently non-functional\n- A large, hull-piercing intrusion situated at the vessel’s core, potentially indicating corrupted exterior schematics\n- 3 floors of useable interior\n- No entrance hatch\n- A launch bay situated in the hull closely resembling technology used to launch creature decoys in the Cyclops submersible\n- A highly advanced internal reactor capable of extracting power from alien sources, as well as harboring significant buildup and concentration of ion energy\n\nThe Alterra corporation advises that this data be uploaded immediately to the nearest trans-gov mandated data terminal to ensure the safe collection of all potentially dangerous alien da--\n\n<b>┛▖▛▚┣┅ protocols activated.
